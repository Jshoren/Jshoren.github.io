        <h1>Welcome to my Page!</h1>
            <p> My name is Jeffrey Shoren.  This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island.  I wrote this web page myself using the HTML programming language that I learned from Github, Khan and Sakai lessons.  The Apps link above has apps I have written that run on phones.  The Javascripts link above has Javascript that I have written to be embedded in web pages.
