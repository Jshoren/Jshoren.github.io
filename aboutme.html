        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> My name is Jeffrey Shoren.  I am a criminal justice major, as well as a digital forensics minor in the University of Rhode Island.  I enjoy computer programming as well as fixing problems that computers might be having.  This includes software and hardware within the computer.  Some things I do in my free time include being a volunteer firefighter at Station 9 in West Kingston, watching movies, and going out to hang with friends.
